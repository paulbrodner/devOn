```

### List available commands

Open one terminal and navigate to the root folder of this project, then type:

```ruby
$ rake -T
```
This command will show you all available `devon` commands that you can run.

**Example** (from devon v2.0.0):

```ruby
rake configs:list                               # List available configurations
rake configs:new                                # Create a new Configuration
rake conn:list                                  # List available connections
rake db:init                                    # Initi/Reinitialize db
rake scripts:list                               # List available scripts
rake scripts:new                                # Create a new script
rake scripts:run                                # Run script (in bash: rake scripts:run CMD=1,2,3 INTERACTIVE=TRUE)
rake scripts:run_all[script,connection,config]  # Run script (in bash: rake scripts:run CMD=1,2,3 INTERACTIVE=TRUE)
rake server:up                                  # Start Sinatra Server
```

### List available SCRIPTS

```ruby
$ rake scripts:list 
```

The command will display all files available in `scripts` folder:

```ruby
[
    [0] "scripts/connect.rb"
]
```
If multiple scripts are created inside `scripts` folder, each one of them is displayed with a particular ID (0-> n)

### List available CONNECTIONS

```ruby
$ rake conn:list
```

The command result will display all files available in `connections` folder:
```ruby
[
    [0] "connections/vagrant.rb {127.0.0.1}"
]
```
If multiple scripts are created inside `connections` folder, each one of them is displayed with a particular ID (0-> n).

Notice that the IP of the target machine is also displayed (taken automatically from [env.yml](connections/env.yml)), for better identification.

### Run scripts

```ruby
$ rake scripts:run
```
One interactive shell is executed. 

**a)** First it will list all available scripts (as we saw above) and ask you to choose a script file to execute from that list.

Let's check the existing one `0` when `Choose a file from scripts to use:` text is displayed and press ENTER.

>**Hint:** for the file available at location `0` you can also press ENTER directly, no need to type `0` then ENTER.

**b)** The interactive task will then display all available connections as we saw in previous paragraph. Type `0` and press ENTER again.

>**Hint:** for the file available at location `0` you can also press ENTER directly, no need to type `0` then ENTER.

Next a list of available configurations is displayed (i.e. what configuration should this tool use in combination with your script). 

In our case, we just execute a shell script (see scripts/connect.rb) listing all files based on choosen configuration (see connections/vagrant.rb), so "No config" can be choosen.

> If you have access to a remote machine via SSH, please change the `connection/env.yml` file, setting up the correct IP address and connection credentials, or spin up a local Virtual Machine using the guideline bellow.

> If you want run a particular script in non-interactive way, you can use the `scripts:run_all` task:
```ruby
$ rake scripts:run_all['scripts/connect.rb','connections/vagrant.rb','']
```
